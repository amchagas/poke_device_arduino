These are the instructions to setup a 3d printed nose poke device using arduino and a couple of
cheap electronic elements.
In case one doesn't have a 3D printer available, a small trip to a hardware shop 
should provide all necessary parts to build a poke device.

The files for printing the part and the wiring diagram can be found in this repository as well.
One of the is *.stl and the other *.


Elements needed:
IR Led
IR photodiode 
Optional:
Color LED
Piezo Buzzer
